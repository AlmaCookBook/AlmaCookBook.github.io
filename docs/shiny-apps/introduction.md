# Introduction to Shiny Apps
## What is Shiny?
Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications directly from R. With Shiny, you can create dashboards, data analysis tools, and visual reports that update in real time as users interact with the app. It's built on top of R and leverages reactive programming to respond instantly to user input.

## Why would you use the Shiny framework?
Shiny is ideal for anyone who wants to share data insights or analysis results in an accessible, interactive format — especially in research, business, and data science. Instead of sending static plots or spreadsheets, you can deliver an app where others can explore different scenarios, filter data, run models, and view results instantly. It’s perfect when you need quick, custom tools without the overhead of full-stack web development.
