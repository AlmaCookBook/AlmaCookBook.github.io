- [VSCode and python learning path modules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/?products=vs-code&terms=python). This is a collection of modules that cover the basics of using VSCode with python.
- [Introduction to computer science with VSCode and python](https://vscodeedu.com/courses/intro-to-python). This 19 hour course is a fully comprehensive introduction to computer science using VSCode and python./ It covers the basics of programming, data structures, algorithms, along with debugging, testing, and version control.


## Extensions
VSCode has a large number of extensions available for a wide range of languages and tools. You can browse and install extensions from within VSCode by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.

Some useful extensions for scientific software development include:

## Configuration
VSCode has a large number of settings that can be configured to customise the editor to your preferences. You can access the settings by clicking on the gear icon in the bottom left of the window, or by pressing `Ctrl + ,`.

You can also configure settings for specific languages and tools by creating a `settings.json` file in the `.vscode` directory in your project.

## Remote Development
VSCode has a number of extensions that allow you to develop code remotely on a different machine or in a container. This is useful if you are working on a machine with limited resources, or if you need to develop code in a different environment to your local machine.  

The Remote-SSH extension allows you to connect to a remote machine over SSH and develop code on that machine. The Remote-Containers extension allows you to develop code in a container, and the Remote - WSL extension allows you to develop code in the Windows Subsystem for Linux.  

To use VSCode for remote-ssh development follow the [remote-ssh instructions](remote.md).  

## Debugging
VSCode has built-in support for debugging code written in a number of languages. You can configure debugging settings in the `.vscode/launch.json` file in your project, and then start a debugging session by clicking on the Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
