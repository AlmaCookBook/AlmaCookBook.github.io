# VSCode extra features

For access to the extra features in VSCode such as co-pilot, you need to sign up to the educators program.  

There is a bit of a 2-stage step for the VSCode license, you need to be a member of the ICR GitHub organisation, 
but then separately you need to apply to the GitHub campus program as a teacher/researcher.  
 
1.	You need a GitHub account with your icr email address, request to be added from schelpdesk.
You don’t **have** to be in the GitHub organisation, you just need the academic email address,
but it makes sense to associate yourself to the ICR GitHub as there are some other free things (like private GitHub actions).  
2.	Additionally you also need to apply to the GitHub campus programme as an individual researcher in an academic institution.
[Researcher@GitHub campus](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application).
You need to sign up to the github campus programme as a teacher, which is also a researcher,
using that GitHub account linked to the icr email address. You need to provide proof that you work for a university –
a photo of your lanyard might do it, or you can ask HR to give you a letter saying you work for the ICR.  
 
It takes a couple of days for the application to go through, and then you will have access to those benefits. 
E.g. in VSCode you download the copilot extension and sign in with github and you will have access to it (it has been a while since I did that so give me a shout if that bit is not obvious!).

Any problems ask for help from schelpdesk!
