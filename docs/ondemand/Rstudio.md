# Running R Studio on Demand

To start the environment:
```
module use /opt/software/easybuild/modules/all
```

it'll give you a newer R version you can load with 
```
module load R/4.2.1-foss-2022a
``` 
(```module load R``` will also work but specifying the version means you'll get the same version if we update it later).
