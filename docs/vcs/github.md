# The ICR's Enterprise GitHub Account

The ICR has an enterprise GitHub account. This is free under academic license and allows us to have private repositories. This is useful for storing code that is not yet ready for public release, or for storing code that is proprietary to the ICR. It also allows us to have documentation and wikis for our repositories and to provide a professional branding and allow collaboration with external collegaues.

The main ICR github account is here: [https://github.com/instituteofcancerresearch](https://github.com/instituteofcancerresearch)  

Groups may have their own individual accounts, for example the [https://github.com/oncogenetics](https://github.com/oncogenetics)  

If you wish to have access to the ICR GitHub, contact the Service Hub and ask for the request to be sent to the **Research Software Engineering team** in Scientific Computing.
