# The ICR's Enterprise GitHub Account

The ICR has an enterprise GitHub account. This is free under academic license and allows us to have private repositories. This is useful for storing code that is not yet ready for public release, or for storing code that is proprietary to the ICR. It also allows us to have documentation and wikis for our repositories and to provide a professional branding and allow collaboration with external colleagues.

The main ICR GitHub account is here: [https://github.com/instituteofcancerresearch](https://github.com/instituteofcancerresearch)  

Groups may have their own individual accounts, for example the [https://github.com/oncogenetics](https://github.com/oncogenetics)  

If you wish to have access to the ICR GitHub, contact the Service Hub and ask for the request to be sent to the **Research Software Engineering team** in Scientific Computing.

ICR staff members can apply for the academic license for GitHub by following the instructions [academic github application](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application).  

- Students qualify for the student license  
- Other staff members qualify for the Teacher license which includes researchers: 

This has a number of benefits such as CoPilot in VSCode.

**Note on pushing code to GitHub if using command line Git**

From August 13, 2021, GitHub removed authentication with username and password. Now, if you want to push you changes to GitHub for the first time, you need to type in your GitHub username and personal access token as a password. Personal access tokens allow access necessary for the use case and are generated per project. More on personal access tokens and how to generate them can be found here: [Managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
