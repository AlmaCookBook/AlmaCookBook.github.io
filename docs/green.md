# Sustainable Computing at the ICR
This is a collection of resources and advice on sustainable computing at the ICR. The advice comes from a collaboration between groups at the ICR engaged with the [GreenDiSC initiative for sustainable computing](https://www.software.ac.uk/GreenDiSC).  

- Breast Cancer Research - Data Science Team, contact Santiago Madera.  
- Research Software Engineering Team, contact Rachel Alcraft.  
- Data Science Team, contact Jacob Househam.  

For any help or questions email [scientific computing](mailto:schelpdesk@icr.ac.uk) and ask for the RSE team.  

## A quick summary of practical actions

### What can you do to be more sustainable?
1. **Measure your carbon footprint**  The application developed by the RSE team [green-alma](https://software-internal.icr.ac.uk/app/green-alma) is a web utility that measures the carbon cost of HPC jobs using the [green-algorithms library](). It is available on the ICR network with the password and username available on request from the RSE team - contact the schelpdesk to ask. You can use this to measure your jobs and carbon use over a given period of time or job id.  
2. **Write efficient code** - 
3. **Check your job efficiency on the HPC** - 
4. **But - your work is more important** - the carbon footprint of your code is important, but, as a researcher working on generally small isolated projects where code efficiency has a minimal impact on the wider world, the work you are doing is more important.
5. **Storage is a big win** - it may be that your biggest win in terms of carbon footprint is in storage, so consider how you can reduce the amount of data you are storing on an ongoing basis. Monitor and reduce continuously, and work with your team to embed this practice.  
6. **Multiple advantages** - Remember that there are usually multiple advantages to anything and these can help with your motivation. For example a more efficient algorithm will run fast er and cost less fainacially as well as in carbon terms.  
7. **Record what you are doing** - keep a record of what you are doing and how you are reducing your carbon footprint. This will help you to see the impact of your changes and to communicate this to others.

### What can Scientific Computing do to be more sustainable?
1. The **efficiency of the data centres** we use has a large impact on the carbon footprint of our work.  
2. The ability to **time-schedule jobs** at periods of low energy use is important.  
Currently we do not have an automatic procedure for time scheduling jobs, nor do we have out of hours support to look after jobs if they were scheduled in this way. Here we need to balance the carbon footprint of our work with the practicalities of our work and this is in progress.  
3. The ability to **measure the carbon footprint of our work** is important.  
We have created the [green-alma](https://software-internal.icr.ac.uk/app/green-alma) app (VPN only) to monitor the carbon footprint of all jobs on Alma.

## Training and Resources

### Internal training at the ICR
These are courses run internally at the ICR, to sign up please visit the pages linked. If there are any courses without dates, please sign up, and also feel free to contact the RSE team for more information.  

- [IEMA Sustainability at the ICR](https://training.icr.ac.uk/coursed.php?course=1046)  
Audience: All staff. As a world-leading research centre, promoting health is at the heart of what we do. We embrace opportunities to advance social, economic and environmental health in our activities and make the ICR a more sustainable organisation. Every member of staff at the ICR plays a part in helping us to achieve these goals.
We’ve taken some major steps towards this already, like developing science-based targets to bring down our carbon emissions and using the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a framework for how we holistically approach sustainability.
We’re inviting all members of staff to participate in these sustainability training courses. They’ll provide opportunities to develop actions and initiatives to create change in your area of work, and to learn what the ICR is doing towards sustainability.
These courses lead to a professional certificate from IEMA, (the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment). 
- [Software carpentries](https://training.icr.ac.uk) 
At the ICR, the RSE team, in collaboration with the Data Science team, deliver caprentry courses in Python, R, Git and Unix. These are designed to help you to be more efficient in your coding and to work more effectively with others, and by using best practices in coding you can reduce the carbon footprint of your work. We use the carpentry materials from the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) organisation.  
  -- [Python](https://training.icr.ac.uk/coursed.php?course=1200)  
  -- [R](https://training.icr.ac.uk/coursed.php?course=1218)  
  -- [Bash](https://training.icr.ac.uk/coursed.php?course=1215)  
  -- [Git](https://training.icr.ac.uk/coursed.php?course=1216)  
  -- [Image processing with python](https://training.icr.ac.uk/coursed.php?course=1217)  
  -- [Genomics](https://training.icr.ac.uk/coursed.php?course=1219)  
  -- Python optimisation - to be announced soon  

- Induction on computational sustainability - this is to be announced soon
